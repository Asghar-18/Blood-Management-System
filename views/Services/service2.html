        <h2>What is Blood Testing?</h2>
        <p>Blood testing is a crucial medical diagnostic procedure that involves the analysis of blood samples to assess
            a person's health, diagnose medical conditions, or monitor the effectiveness of treatments.</p>

        <h2>Why is Blood Testing Important?</h2>
        <p>Blood tests provide valuable information about various aspects of health, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Detecting and diagnosing medical conditions, such as anemia, diabetes, and infections.</li>
            <li>Monitoring organ function, such as liver and kidney health.</li>
            <li>Evaluating cholesterol levels and cardiovascular risk.</li>
            <li>Assessing blood clotting abilities.</li>
            <li>Checking for drug levels in the bloodstream.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Types of Blood Tests</h2>
        <p>There are numerous types of blood tests, each serving a specific purpose. Some common blood tests include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Complete Blood Count (CBC): Measures different components of blood, including red blood cells, white
                blood cells, and platelets.</li>
            <li>Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP): Evaluates electrolyte levels, kidney function, and blood glucose levels.
            </li>
            <li>Lipid Panel: Assesses cholesterol levels and cardiovascular risk.</li>
            <!-- Add more types of blood tests as needed -->
        </ul>

        <h2>How Blood Testing Works</h2>
        <p>Blood testing typically involves the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Sample Collection: A healthcare professional collects a small sample of blood, usually from a vein in
                the arm.</li>
            <li>Laboratory Analysis: The blood sample is sent to a laboratory where specialized equipment and techniques
                are used to analyze it.</li>
            <li>Results Interpretation: A healthcare provider interprets the results and discusses them with the
                patient.</li>
